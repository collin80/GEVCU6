/*
 * The purpose of this file is to create a "device" that is used to interface with all of the other enabled
 * devices in order to create a custom control system for your car. Each main device has configuration options
 * and is meant for generalized usage. But, what if you want to go further? Perhaps you've got a PowerKeyPro
 * keypad and you want to be able to select different regen powers or drive power settings? The default device
 * drivers don't support such things because they're generic. Or, perhaps you want to allow
 * your BMS and motor controller to talk? Maybe the BMS can limit regen or drive power automatically based on battery
 * conditions. The code doesn't currently support such things but it would be possible to read the BMS here and then update
 * the motor controller. The options are endless. The below code will be updated to show what Collin has done with a reference car
 * in order to show what is possible and how it could be coded. Feel free to delete any code not appropriate to your car and/or
 * add any extra code you need to make GEVCU do what you want.
 * This is a device like any other so it is disabled by default and will have to be enabled if you need to use it.
