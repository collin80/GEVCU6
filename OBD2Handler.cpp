/*
 * OBD2Handler.cpp - A simple utility class that can be used to handle OBDII traffic
 * of any form. It takes pointers to buffers where upwards of 8 characters reside.
 * Doesn't care about how the traffic came in or how it'll go out. That is handled
 * in places like CanPIDListener or ELM327Emu

	outData[0] is the length of the data actually returned
	outData[1] is the returned mode (input mode + 0x40)
	there after, the rest of the bytes are the data requested. This should be 1-5 bytes
