## How to contribute to Seeed Software

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_CAN/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_CAN/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .md file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**Bug** issues](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_CAN/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
  * [**feature** issues](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_CAN/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
