due_can
=======

Object oriented canbus library for Arduino Due compatible boards

Implements both CAN buses exposed by Due hardware.

This library requires the can_common library now. That library
is a common base that other libraries can be built off of to allow
a more universal API for CAN. 

The needed can_common library is found here:
