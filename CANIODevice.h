/*
 * CANIODevice.h parent of canbus connected devices that can extent the system I/O.
 * does not specifically handle canopen for devices that use it. However, most devices can be
 * pretty easily faked for canopen support. Just register for messages that contain the device ID
 * as the lower 7 bits and allow all upper 4 bit patterns through. For canopen you have to
 * send on ID 0 but you aren't going to be receiving.
