/*
Format these fault codes in DTC format.
DTC uses 16 bits to store a code
Byte A is the first byte, B is the second byte
A7-6 = Which fault system (00=P=PowerTrain, 01=C=Chassis, 10=B=Body, 11=U=Network)
A5-4 = First Digit (0-3)
A3-0 = Second Digit (0-F)
B7-4 = Third Digit (0-F)
B3-0 = Last / Fourth Digit (0-F)

Many codes are already used in ICE vehicles but rarely with hex digits so exclusively use
codes with hex digits to avoid overlap
