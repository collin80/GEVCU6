GEVCU
=====

Generalized Electric Vehicle Control Unit

Our website can be found at : http://www.evtv.me

A project to create a fairly Arduino compatible ECU firmware
to interface with various electric vehicle hardware over CANbus
(and possibly other comm channels)

The project now builds in the Arduino IDE. So, use it to compile, send the firmware to the GEVCU hardware, and monitor serial. It all works very nicely.

You will need the following to have any hope of compiling and running the firmware:
- A GEVCU board. This version supports hardware 6.23c and later.
- Arduino IDE 1.5.4 - or later even 1.8.13 or such newer IDEs should work fine.
- All below libraries can be gotten from the repos at github.com/collin80
- due_can
- can_common
- due_rtc
- due_wire
- DueTimer
- microsmooth library
- Adafruit_BLE_SPI - You need the DEV branch of this library.
- Wire_EEPROM
- firmware_receiver
- pwm_lib

All libraries belong in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries (Windows) or ~/Arduino/libraries (Linux/Mac).
You will need to remove -master or any other postfixes. Your library folders should be named as above.

The canbus is supposed to be terminated on both ends of the bus. If you are testing with a DMOC and GEVCU then you've got two devices, each on opposing ends of the bus. GEVCU hardware is already terminated internally.
